:: How to Play
TADG is a text based game with many choices. Basically follow the game and read as you go along. Thats really it!

Potions start with $potionHP health points.
Players start with $health and have a starting max health of $healthMax.

:: About [About]
TADG is a Text Adventure Dungeon Game or TADG for short. The idea came to fruition when I 
wanted to start game design many years ago. I found that I needed something I would enjoy 
creating and challenging to create, but not too hard that I would give up. 

This game started out in Java as a very bad version and now I am transitioning it to Twine 
because I feel like I can accomplish more with a game engine which was built around text games. 
Eventually I plan on recreating it in Java but for now this is were I stand.

:: IntroStory

As you explore around your camp site you stubble upon what looks to be ancient ruins of a long lost
civilization.
<<linkappend "Do you explore it?">>
As you stubble through the ruins you find what looks likes an old run down door. You slowly open it as 
it makes many creaking noises. What do you do?
